# Delta-Green-Character-Generator
A character generator for the tabletop RPG 'Delta Green'

Delta Green is a tabletop RPG with a fairly simple character generation process.

This is my attempt to automate large portions of this process so it can interface with an excel sheet on Google Drive.

To run it yourself you'll need EZSheets, Python and a Google API key of your own.

EZSheet's docs detail this process pretty well:

# Step 1: Determine Statistics

This is an example of random stat generation, however a user can input custom choices through point buy or choose from a standard array:
**Well Rounded:** 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 11
**Focused:** 15, 14, 12, 11, 10, 10
**Highly Focused:** 17, 14, 12, 10, 10, 9

# Step 2: Calculate Derived Attributes

Once stats are determined, your derived attributes are calculated automatically.

# Step 3: Select Profession & Skills

You can select a profession from a list of given professions. Information is displayed like how they related to the Delta Green agency, stats that come with the profession, and chooseable stats.

Afterward, you can choose bonus skills from a wide array of premade backgrounds

# Step 4: Define Bonds

Randomly generated bonds aren't much to see. The value of a bond is equal to an agent's CHA and the generated bonds are meant to inspire.

# Step 5: Add The Final Details

Lastly, determine if the agent is damaged, their name, date of birth, bio, etc.

I've also added the option to start with the Police Officer's go bag from the book. I feel like it's a good starting point for any agent really.

A completed sheet looks like this.
